Eyebrow threading is an ancient hair-removal technique, practiced for centuries among the most beautiful women of Asia and the
Middle East. It is the best alternative to waxing and tweezing, especially for sensitive skin. Eyebrow threading is a depilation
 technique which originated in India, although it is also widely practiced in the Middle East. Salons in Western nations offered
 the service to Middle Eastern clients for decades before European and American women became interested and the popularity
  of eyebrow threading skyrocketed. The hair removal technique is not just for the eyebrows: threading can be used to remove
  other facial and body hair as well. Eyebrow threading is a preferred hair removal technique for a number of reasons. Unlike
   tweezing or plucking, eyebrow threading removes one clean line of hair all at once, making it much quicker and easier to
   shape the brows. Eyebrow threading also will not harm the skin like wax and some depilatory creams can. If done correctly,
   the skin should not be red or irritated for more than a few minutes after the eyebrow threading session. Some aestheticians
    also find it easier to shape eyebrows using this technique than other methods available.",

A facial is one of the best ways to take care of your skin, especially when it's given by an experienced, knowledgeable
esthetician. A facial cleans, exfoliates and nourishes the skin, promoting a clear, well-hydrated complexion, and can
help your skin look younger.",

Henna is a flowering plant. The leaves of the Henna plant contain a natural and very effective coloring pigment:
Lawsone. This Orange/Red dye releases as the leaves are crushed. Drying, milling, and sifting the Henna leaves
 into a fine powder maximizes the pigment release"
